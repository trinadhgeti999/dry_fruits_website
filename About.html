                        <p>A dry fruits shop is a specialist business that sells a large range of 
                            dried fruits, nuts, and seeds. These stores often sell a wide range of items, 
                            from almonds, cashews, and pistachios to dried apricots, figs, and dates. They 
                            frequently provide raw and roasted variations, as well as salted and unsalted nuts. 
                            Some dry fruit stores may also sell similar goods such as dried coconut, raisins, and 
                            trail mixes. These establishments are popular among health-conscious people since 
                            dried fruits and nuts are commonly regarded as healthful snacks high in vitamins, 
                            minerals, and important fats.</p>
